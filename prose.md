**Egress** - cost for moving data outside the provider's cloud to the Internet, such as other cloud platforms or end users. If you stay within the provider's cloud - for example, reading a COG from an EC2 instance - this is usually free.

**Transactions** - costs for the quantity of HTTP requests. Unlike egress, this applies within a single cloud platform. Providers usually price read (GET) and write (PUT, POST) operations differently.
